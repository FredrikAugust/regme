# regme
App for self-registration at events.

# Todo
General:
* Go BACK to MDL? (4th redesign)
* Become as feature "complete" as rfidera
* Feedback - What should RegMe have that isn't already in rfidera?

API:
- [ ] Setup api (OAuth2.0, config, keys)
- [ ] Connect to api (Try to set up locally first)
- [ ] Fetch real data (Just fetch once, then use async api-calls later)
- [ ] Change react.js to find right fields in api-json
- [ ] Read-api-calls to fetch data asynchronously
- [ ] Put-api-calls to add users
