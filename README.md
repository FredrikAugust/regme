- [ ] Become as feature "complete" as rfidera

API:
- [ ] Setup api (OAuth2.0, config, keys)
- [ ] Connect to api (Try to set up locally first)

- [ ] Handholding: Notify user about their state, guide them every step which is nessesary
- [ ] Printing pdf with more information about allergies and meet-up

Feedback:

Code:
